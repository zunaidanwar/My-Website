​1. About the Project
​Rahi Originals is a brand born from a passion for honest craftsmanship and a deep respect for the planet. This website was meticulously designed to reflect the brand's core values, bridging the gap between a modern digital presence and a legacy of handmade quality. It provides a clean, elegant platform to tell the brand's story, showcase its unique products, and build a lasting connection with a global audience.
​This project was built as a single-file, multi-page static site to ensure lightning-fast performance, security, and a seamless user experience.
​2. Tech Stack
​HTML5: Used for a clean, semantic document structure.
​CSS3: Utilized for all styling, including custom layouts (Flexbox, Grid), responsive design via media queries, and animations. No external frameworks were used to maintain a lightweight and efficient codebase.
​3. Features
​Multi-Page Experience: A single HTML file simulates a multi-page website with a responsive navigation system.
​Mobile-First Design: The layout is optimized for mobile devices first, ensuring a flawless user experience on any screen size.
​Brand-Aligned Aesthetics: A custom color palette and typography were chosen to reflect the brand's premium, eco-friendly, and handcrafted identity.
​Structured Data (Schema Markup): The website is enhanced with schema.org markup (Organization, LocalBusiness, and Product) to improve SEO and help search engines understand the content.
​Performance-Optimized: The code is clean, lightweight, and requires no external libraries, ensuring minimal load times.
​4. Design & Branding
​Color Palette: The design uses a thoughtful color palette to evoke a sense of honesty and elegance.
​Primary: #3B2E40 (Deep Purple-Brown) - For text and headers.
​Secondary: #D07A3B (Burnt Orange) - For accents and call-to-action buttons.
​Background: #F7F7F7 (Light Gray) - The main canvas of the website.
​Typography: The website uses a combination of two fonts to convey a sense of legacy and modernity.
​Serif: Cormorant Garamond - Used for headlines to provide a classic, timeless feel.
​Sans-Serif: Montserrat - Used for body text for readability and a clean, modern look.
​5. Project Structure
​This project is a single-file static site. The file is structured with distinct, internally-linked sections that create the illusion of separate pages.
The key sections of index.html include:
#home: The hero section and brand introduction.
#about: The brand story and mission statement.
#shop: A product gallery with detailed product descriptions.
#contact: A simple contact form and brand information.
6. Getting Started
To view and customize the website, simply open the index.html file in any web browser.
To Customize:
Text: Replace the placeholder text in the HTML sections with your own content.
Images: Replace the placeholder image URLs (https://via.placeholder.com/) with your own high-quality product and lifestyle photos.
7. Future Enhancements
JavaScript: Add JavaScript for form validation on the contact page and to create more dynamic user interactions.
Build Tools: Use a build tool like Gulp or Webpack to minify CSS and HTML for even faster performance.
Server: Host the website on a service like Netlify or Vercel for free hosting and a custom domain.
